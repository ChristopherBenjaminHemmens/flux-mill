Should you wish to build:
Required parts for build. 3D Print 8 (2 big, 6 small) cogs/gears. 3D Print 8x big (left) cylinder and 48x small (right) cylinder.
Each cylinder sits at 360/8 = 45 degree angles from the next cylinder.

Cylinder | offsets
--- | ---
Cyl1 | 0/360 degrees
Cyl2 | 45 degrees
Cyl3 | 90 degrees
Cyl4 | 135 degrees
Cyl5 | 180 degrees
Cyl6 | 225 degrees
Cyl7 | 270 degrees
Cyl8 | 315 degrees

Middle axel is rotated at 5 degrees against outer axels and held in place using the gears/cogs, see hypothesis.

Parts:
 * [7x 8mm diameter x at least 120mm steel rod for a shaft.](https://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/B07TS6Y2JB/)
 * [14x 8mm bore bearings](https://www.amazon.nl/DXLing-Aligning-Rhombus-Machinery-Conveyor/dp/B08CTWCT8Z/)
 * [147x 10x3mm N52 Neodymium magnets](https://www.amazon.nl/gp/product/B07KW54QB1/)
 * [56x 2mm steel rods to hold everything in place.](https://www.amazon.nl/Creativ-58026-staaf-10-stuks/dp/B009ZSIOZQ/)
 * Some adhesive to stick magnets down.
 * A mounting frame. See hypothesis for measurements
